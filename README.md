# 279R-HW0

## How to use:

In the top right corner click on the green "Code" button and select "Download ZIP". Opening the Zip file, you should have a folder called 279R-HW0-main. Double click on the file titled "index.html". This should open up a page in your browser that looks like the below:

If this doesn't work, you can also open a new Google Chrome window and under "File" in the toolbar select "Open File". Navigate to the 279R-HW0-main folder, select index.html and click "Open".
